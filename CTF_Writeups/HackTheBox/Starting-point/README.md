# Hack The Box: Starting Point Machines

Welcome to the **Starting Point** section of my Hack The Box write-ups. This path is designed for those new to penetration testing, offering an introduction to the core tools, techniques, and methodologies used in the field.

## What is the Starting Point Path?

The Starting Point path on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) is ideal for beginners, focusing on foundational concepts such as:

- Network reconnaissance
- Common services (FTP, SSH)
- Exploitation of public vulnerabilities
- Basic Linux and Windows privilege escalation

Through these machines, I’ve learned how to approach and exploit systems, gaining practical experience with industry-standard tools.

## Approach to Each Machine

For each Starting Point machine, my write-ups follow a consistent structure, which includes:

1. **Introduction**: 
   - A brief description of the machine and its difficulty level.
   
2. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The steps taken to scan and enumerate the target (e.g., Nmap, directory scanning).
   
3. **Exploitation**:
   - Details on how vulnerabilities were identified and exploited.
   
4. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Steps taken for privilege escalation or other post-exploitation activities, leading to capturing the flag.

5. **Lessons Learned**:
   - Key takeaways and reflections on what I learned from the machine.

## List of Machines

In this section, you’ll find my detailed write-ups for the following machines:
  
- **Meow**:

- **Dancing**:

- **Redeemer**:

- **Other Machines**: I will continue adding more machines as I progress through the Starting Point path. Each write-up will build on the previous, demonstrating my growing understanding of penetration testing concepts.

## Tools and Techniques Used

Throughout these machines, I’ve used several key tools that are common in penetration testing, such as:

- **Nmap** for scanning and discovering open ports.
- **Hydra** for brute-forcing passwords.
- **Metasploit** for exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Basic Linux commands** for navigating and manipulating the system after gaining access.

## Why Starting Point Machines?

The Starting Point machines have been invaluable in building my foundational skills in ethical hacking. They offer an accessible way to learn and apply basic concepts, giving me confidence to take on more advanced challenges in the future.

I believe this journey will equip me with the necessary skills to transition into more complex penetration testing tasks as I continue to grow in this field.
